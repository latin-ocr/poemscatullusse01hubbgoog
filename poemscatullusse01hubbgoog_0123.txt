CARMEN XXII.
To Alpheum.

A remonstrance with AlphenuS, who had gained

÷ and betrayed the confidence and affection of Catul-
lus· 'Phe sentiment of the poem is sorrow rather

ἶ than anger. The poet touches on the unfaithful-
ness of his friend, t‘he tendency of such breaches of
confidenceto produce mutual distrust among mon,
and reminds him of the anger of the gods who

p guard the rights of friendship‚ and punish their vio-

ἰ lation.

CARMEN XXIII.
’ To the peniusula Sirmio.

This poem was composed on the occasion of the
poet’s return, care-worn and dejected‚ from his wea-
risome and fruitless 'expedition to Bithynia, to his
beautiful and fondly-loved retreat at Sirmio. The
feeling of home-joy which he expresses, is simple
and natural, and every heart sympathizes with it.

“Sirmio was a peninsular promontory, of about
two miles circumference, projecting into the lake
Benacus, now the Lago di Garda.”

“ Sirmione appears as an island, so low and no
nmow is the bank that unite: it to the main land.
