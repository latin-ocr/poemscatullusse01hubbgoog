22.] In the earlier editione, the following verses
are arranged by themselves, as the conclusion of a
poem left imperfect, with the title Ad Gumerium
The preceding verses seem to have in themselves
such unity and completeneSS, as to make the suppo-
“ sition that they ere an entire poem by themselveS,
very plausible. Yet they fit so well together from
the general resemblance of subject, (which induced
Scaliger and Doering to join them, end which may
be done without impeiring the requisite unity of the
whole,) as to render it very probable that they were q
originally one. '

23. custos ille Oretum] ‘ Talus? e giant with a.
brazen body, fabled to have been given by Jupiter
to Europa, und made guardian of the island of Crete 3
which he went round three times·every day. Plato,
in his Minoe, has given this explanation of the fable ;
that Minos who made Rhadamanthus judge in the
capital, committed the rest of the island to ΤαΙιιε, and
that he thrice a year made a circuit through all the
cities and villages of the country admin'istering jus·
tice, according to laws which were engraved on
tables of brues·
