CARMEN XIV.

An image of Priapus standing in a garden, ad-
dresses some mischievous hoya, who were disposed
¹ to plunder on the groundS, mentions the various·
gifts and observanceS, by which the owner had
ι sought to secure his favor, with his own duty of
ι watchfulneSS, and points out to their rapacity, a
y richer vineyard and a more negligent Priapus·
This poem and the next, may be considered a
ἐ locus clue-sicus on the worship of Priapus, There
are few passages, if any, in the whole of Latin liter-
ature, which more fully and strikingly evince, what
we find it very difficult to comprehend, the earnest
sincerity of the rustic worshipper. One can hardly
rise from this truly poetica] picture of the poor hun-
bandmnn and his son in their devout offerings,
without feeling that though the philosopher might
despise, and the cultivated poet sneer or ridicule,
yet they viere influenced by a real saith in the
power, anda real hope of the favor of the Deity they*
nerved.
