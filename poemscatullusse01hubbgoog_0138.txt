Wh0‚ hanging on his mother’s breast,
To his known sire shall turn his eyes,·

Outstretch his infant arms a while,
Half ope his little lips and smile.'‘

CARMEN XL.

This poem consiste of alternate sti-ains, sung by 2

choirs of youths and maidens. After a brief contest
*on the merits and demerita of the evening star,
whose rising marked the hour of their meeting‚ the

maidens chant the praises of maidenhood, and the ὲ

rival youths the worth and dignity of married life.
The poem closes with an address to the lady, on

whose nuptials it was composed, persuading her to j
lay aside her girlish bashfulness‚ and commit her· -

self cheerfully and confidently to the arms of her
husband. This is supposed to have been written

on the same occasion with the preceding poem, Ι
having relation to a different portion of the cere· οἳ

mony‚ end in order of time preceding.
