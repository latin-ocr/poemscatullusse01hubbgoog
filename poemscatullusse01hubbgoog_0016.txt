Catullus has used this verse more frequently
than any other in Carm. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 17, 18, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. A
species called pseudo Phalaecian, occurs with the
pure Phalaecian' in Carm. 37. It differs from the
pure in that the first foot may be a tribrachyS, and
the second a trochee‚ and osten a spondee.
