‘⁴ Bless’d as the immor-tal gods is he,
The youth who fondly sits by thee,
And hears and sees thee all the while
Softiy speak and sweetly smile.

And rais’d such tumults in my breast3
For while Ι gued, in transport tossed,
My breath was gone, my voice was lo'st3

My bosom glowed3 the §ubtle flame
Ran quick through all my vital frame3
O’er my dim eyes a darkness hung3
My ears with hollow murmura rung.
