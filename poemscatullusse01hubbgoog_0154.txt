οΑΒΜΕΝ, XLV.

To Manlius.
The poet begins this letter to ManliuS‚ by ren-

dering him thanks sor the friendship which induced J
him in his affliction, to apply to himself for consola· ⁸
tion3 and mentions the loss of his brother, and the

inconvenience of his situation at Verona, as an ex·

cuse for omitting to comply with his request. The Ῐ
remainder of the poem is »occupied with the praises ἲ

of Manlius, allusions to the kindness Catullus had

received from him, and a somewhat long digression ι.

in praise of a lady, to whose favor he had been in-
troduced by Manlius.
