CARMEN LX.

To Licinius Calvus.

On the early death of Quintilla, eolacing his
grief with the hope that if an affectionate remem-
’ branee by the sur-vivore, may be grateful to the de·
parted‚ the sadness of her untimely loss of the Joys
Ι of lise, would be overpaid by the strength and con-

staney of his love.

Catullus had gone to Troa5‚ t'o pay the last honora
to the Manes of his brother, who was buried there.
After the usual solemnitieS, he addresses the dead
in the word-s of this poe-m. The love of Catullus
for his brother, the only relative he mentione, is one
of the brighter features ina character too deeply
utained with the lieentioueness of the age.

CARMEN an.

of keeping secretS.
